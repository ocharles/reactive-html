#+TITLE: reactive-html

Welcome to =reactive-html=, a small library for building reactive web
applications with GHCJS and =reactive-banana=. This project is currently a work
in progress, but if you want to play along at home - feel free! The easiest path
is to make sure you have [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]] installed, and then you can do:

#+begin_src bash
nix-shell --option binary-caches https://ryantrinkle.com:5443 --run 'ghcjs Main.hs'
chromium Main.jsexe/index.html
#+end_src

If Nix complains about an untrusted binary cache, you will need to make sure
that Ryan's cache is marked as trusted. If you run NixOS, add this to your
=configuration.nix=:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
nix.trustedBinaryCaches = [https://ryantrinkle.com:5443];
#+END_SRC

If you are just running Nix, I believe you'll need to add this to your
=/etc/nix/nix.conf= file (sorry OS X users, I don't know where this file is for
you!):

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
trusted-binary-caches = https://ryantrinkle.com:5443
#+END_SRC
